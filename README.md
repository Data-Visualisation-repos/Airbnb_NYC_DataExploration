# Airbnb NYC Data Exploration Project

The goal of this exercise is to explore NYC data, clean it up, and model it to build data vizualizations. As I go through this task, I will try to answer 3 specific questions

1. Which location has the highest number of listings
2. What room types are most common and their avg price in each neighbourhood
3. What are the common words used to describe the listings

I have used the following sources as a guide to build this project

1. https://towardsdatascience.com/an-extensive-guide-to-exploratory-data-analysis-ddd99a03199e
2. https://towardsdatascience.com/data-exploration-on-airbnb-singapore-01-40698c54cac3

Any feedback can be emailed to rekula.d@gmail.com
